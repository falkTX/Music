I'm tired
tired of waiting

my chest hurts
i see you in pain, i see you unhappy
I want to help somehow, but I don't see a way
everytime I even try, I get pushed back
it hurts to see you like this, and me just watching from the side.
I don't know what to do

my confort zone is no longer effective
the thoughts of you break through everytime, and I can't stop them
I just want to be with you, to see you again, to hear you again
but you're busy and tired, you don't have time or energy for that anymore

I appreciate the times we can still chat
at least we have that, for now

what should I do, when I dream about you?
when I wake up, and you're the first thing on my mind
when I go through the day, and see your face everywhere
I can't run away

I have so many dreams
seems they will remain just that
maybe if I wait long enough
but I'm just fooling myself thinking that way
if things continue like this, I will only push you away
so I know what this means...

you're the most important thing in my life right now.
and can I act like everything else

it's never going to happen
I need to accept that
but I am persistent, and stupid perhaps
I can't let you go
